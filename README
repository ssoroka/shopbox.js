= Shopbox

  A simple extensible lightbox that separates animation and presentation completely from Javascript.  Animation and styling is all CSS3, no crappy images, no crappy js animations.

  Can display iframes, html, images, whatever

  Doesn't do image galleries or captions, though it should be easy to extend if you really really want that.

  See the shopbox_example.html
